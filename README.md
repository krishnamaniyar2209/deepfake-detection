# Robust Deepfake Detection Using Learning-Based Computer Vision Methods

Binary deepfake detection with a focus on building robust models that **generalize across multiple datasets**. The goal is not just high accuracy on FaceForensics++, but strong cross-dataset performance on unseen data sources such as CelebDF, DFDC, and others — ensuring real-world applicability for content moderation.

**Course:** CS 668 — Analytics Capstone
**Instructor:** Dr. Krishna Bathula

> 📌 **About this repository:** This is my copy of a **4-person team capstone**. The original team repository is **[abraraltaf92/deepfake-detection](https://github.com/abraraltaf92/deepfake-detection)**.
> **My role:** co-developer — one of the two engineers who built the end-to-end ML pipeline (data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and cross-dataset evaluation).

## Quick Start

1. **Clone this repo** to your Google Drive:
   ```bash
   # In Google Colab:
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   !git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/deepfake-detection.git /content/drive/MyDrive/deepfake-detection
   ```

2. **Download datasets** and place them in `data/raw/` inside the repo folder:
   ```
   deepfake-detection/
   └── data/
       └── raw/
           └── ff-c23/FaceForensics++_C23/   ← put FF++ dataset here
   ```
   - [FaceForensics++ C23](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics)
   - [CelebDF v2](https://github.com/yuezunli/celeb-deepfakeforensics)

3. **Update `REPO_ROOT`** in `configs/paths.py` if your Drive path differs (default: `/content/drive/MyDrive/deepfake-detection`)

4. **Open notebooks in Google Colab** in numbered order:
   ```
   01_data_ingestion.ipynb → 02_eda.ipynb → 03_preprocessing.ipynb →
   04_model_baseline.ipynb → 05_model_advanced.ipynb → 06_evaluation.ipynb
   ```
